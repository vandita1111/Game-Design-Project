Idea: Flappy bird but with a laptop instead
Spacebar/ mouse clicks to flap 
there are letters on the screen and you have to type them to get all they keys
HOW TO MAKE IT SO IT RECORDS VERSION HISTORY ???


What I need for just a game:
* Import java.swing/awts 
* Make public game window (extends JPanel, implements action listener, keyListener) –private
   * Give width, height– final
   * Bird size –final
   * Pipe width, gap, speed– final
   * Gravity??-- final
   * Bird y coordinate
   * Bird velocity
   * Array of rectangles (pipes)
   * Score
   * Gameover (boolean)
   * Timer
   * Current letter
   * set<chareacter> letters
   * Boolean game started


* Public Method for game
   * Set size ??
   * Set background (color.Brown) **brown for desk??
   * setFocusable(true) **he did this in his example
   * addKeyListener(this)
   * Bird y coordinate = height of window /2 
   * Bird velocity = ??
   * pipes= new array list of rects
   * Set score to 0
   * gameOver = false
   * currentLetter= 
   * letters= new set includes abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   * New timer (?? ,this) 
   * Start timer
   * Method to generate pipe
   * Method to generate letters
* Public method to generate letters
   * Current letter= getrandom letter method
* Public get random method
   * Arraylist of characters is the remaining letters in the array of letters
   * Shuffle so random
   * Return a letter
* Public method to generate random pipes 
   * Pipe x value= wdith/4 <- HAVE THE DIVIDOR INCREASE AS LEVELS INCREASE
   * Gap position = random int (must be within height: height- pipe gap)
   * Top pipe = new rectangle (pipe, 0 , width, position)
   * bottom= new rect( pipe, gaap position+pipe gap, height, - gap pos-pipe gap)
   * Add top pipe
   * Add bottom pipe
* Method to move pipes
   * For every pipe in pipes
      * Set the location
      * If the pipe is less than coordinate 0 remove pipes
* Method for bird to jump
   * velocity= -??
   * gameStart = true (start game when player presses space key
   * timer.start() (start timer)
* Method to update bird position
   * Bird y coord += velocity of bird
   * Bird velocity is affected by gravity (bbird velocity =+ gravity)
   * If y coordinate of bird is out of frame (<0 or y coordinate+ bird size >height of frame)         
      * game over =true
      * PICTURE OF BIRD CHANGES
   * COLLISION
   * For piped in pipe 
      * If the pipe interests  (new rect(width/2 - birdsize / 2 , bird y cood, bird size, bird size)
         * Game over= true
         * PICTURE OF BIRD CHANGES
* GRAPHICS (OVERIDE)
* paintCompontent(graphics g)
   * super.paintComponent(g)
   * FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOAD IN FILE FOR BIRD
      * If number of correct letters is 24 update image
      * If game over update image
      * If bird flaps update image
   * g.setColor(color.blue
   * g.fillRect (width/ 2 - birdsize/ 2, bird y coord, bird size, bird size)
   * G.set color (red)
   * For pipes in pipe
      * g.fillrect(pipe, pipe, pipe width, pipe height)
   * Gset color (black)
   * Set font ariel bold size 
   * Drawstring (score:” +(score+ count correct letters()), coordinates
   * Set font ariel bold size
   * Drawstring current letter, coordinate
   * If game is over print game over
* When action performed
   * If game is not over and it has been started
      * Move the pipes and update the bird methos
      * Repaint
* When key is typed 
* When key is pressed
   * If character == current letter and the game is still happening generate new letter
   * If space is pressed jump()
   * Restart game?
* Key release
* Restart game method (reset all valiables
* Method to count number of correct letters
* Main method 
   * Jframe frame = new Jframe flappy bird game
   * Flappy bird game game = new game
   * frame.add(game)
   * Frame.pack
   * Frame.setdefault close opp (exit on close)
   * Set location relative to
   * Set visible
